### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lucas Trindade, a brazilian software developer with expertise in front-end development with more than 8 years of experience (just a few more months to achieve 9). I really like to study other technologies, so my knowledgement isn't limited to front-end, but back-end, APIs, cloud and others as well.

### Currently Studying

I'm currently studying cloud technologies and processes, such as AWS, Kubernetes and Terraforming to have a solid knowledgment about scalling, observability and maintenance. I'm studying about NestJs and Python as well, to grow more as a back-end and software developer.
But life is always changing, so I like to keep myself updated about the technologies that I already know and the ones that I want to study.

### My Stacks

## Dominate and work daily

## I know this but I don't use it daily

## I've had worked with this, but need to update myself

## I have a basic knowledge of this
